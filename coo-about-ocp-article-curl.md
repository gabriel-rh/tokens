# Chapter 2. Cluster Observability Operator Overview

---

## Cluster Observability Operator Overview

The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional component of the OpenShift Container Platform designed for creating and managing highly customizable monitoring stacks. It enables cluster administrators to automate configuration and management of monitoring needs extensively, offering a more tailored and detailed view of each namespace compared to the default OpenShift Container Platform monitoring system.

The COO deploys the following monitoring components:

- **Prometheus** - A highly available Prometheus instance capable of sending metrics to an external endpoint by using remote write.
- **Thanos Querier** (optional) - Enables querying of Prometheus instances from a central location.
- **Alertmanager** (optional) - Provides alert configuration capabilities for different services.
- **[UI plugins](observability-ui-plugins#observability-ui-plugins-overview)** (optional) - Enhances the observability capabilities with plugins for monitoring, logging, distributed tracing, and troubleshooting.
- **Korrel8r** (optional) - Provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open-source Korrel8r project.
- **[Incident detection](observability-ui-plugins#coo-incident-detection-overview_monitoring-ui-plugin)** (optional) - Groups related alerts into incidents, to help you identify the root causes of alert bursts.

### COO Compared to Default Monitoring Stack

The COO components function independently of the default in-cluster monitoring stack, which is deployed and managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO). Monitoring stacks deployed by the two Operators do not conflict. You can use a COO monitoring stack in addition to the default platform monitoring components deployed by the CMO.

The key differences between COO and the default in-cluster monitoring stack are shown in the following table:

| Feature                     | COO                                                                                          | Default Monitoring Stack                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope and integration**   | Offers comprehensive monitoring and analytics for enterprise-level needs, covering cluster and workload performance. However, it lacks direct integration with OpenShift Container Platform and typically requires an external Grafana instance for dashboards. | Limited to core components within the cluster, for example, API server and etcd, and to OpenShift-specific namespaces. There is deep integration into OpenShift Container Platform including console dashboards and alert management in the console. |
| **Configuration and customization** | Broader configuration options including data retention periods, storage methods, and collected data types. The COO can delegate ownership of single configurable fields in custom resources to users by using Server-Side Apply (SSA), which enhances customization. | Built-in configurations with limited customization options. |
| **Data retention and storage** | Long-term data retention, supporting historical analysis and capacity planning. | Shorter data retention times, focusing on short-term monitoring and real-time detection. |

### Key Advantages of Using COO

Deploying COO helps you address monitoring requirements that are hard to achieve using the default monitoring stack.

#### Extensibility

- You can add more metrics to a COO-deployed monitoring stack, which is not possible with core platform monitoring without losing support.
- You can receive cluster-specific metrics from core platform monitoring through federation.
- COO supports advanced monitoring scenarios like trend forecasting and anomaly detection.

#### Multi-Tenancy Support

- You can create monitoring stacks per user namespace.
- You can deploy multiple stacks per namespace or a single stack for multiple namespaces.
- COO enables independent configuration of alerts and receivers for different teams.

#### Scalability

- Supports multiple monitoring stacks on a single cluster.
- Enables monitoring of large clusters through manual sharding.
- Addresses cases where metrics exceed the capabilities of a single Prometheus instance.

#### Flexibility

- Decoupled from OpenShift Container Platform release cycles.
- Faster release iterations and rapid response to changing requirements.
- Independent management of alerting rules.

### Target Users for COO

COO is ideal for users who need high customizability, scalability, and long-term data retention, especially in complex, multi-tenant enterprise environments.

#### Development and Operations Teams

COO provides fine-grained monitoring and customizable observability views for in-depth troubleshooting, anomaly detection, and performance tuning during development and operations.

### Using Server-Side Apply to Customize Prometheus Resources

Server-Side Apply is a feature that enables collaborative management of Kubernetes resources. The control plane tracks how different users and controllers manage fields within a Kubernetes object. It introduces the concept of field managers and tracks ownership of fields. This centralized control provides conflict detection and resolution, and reduces the risk of unintended overwrites.

Compared to Client-Side Apply, it is more declarative, and tracks field management instead of last applied state.

- **Server-Side Apply**: Declarative configuration management by updating a resourceâ€™s state without needing to delete and recreate it.
- **Field Management**: Users can specify which fields of a resource they want to update, without affecting the other fields.
- **Managed Fields**: Kubernetes stores metadata about who manages each field of an object in the `managedFields` field within metadata.
- **Conflicts**: If multiple managers try to modify the same field, a conflict occurs. The applier can choose to overwrite, relinquish control, or share management.
- **Merge Strategy**: Server-Side Apply merges fields based on the actor who manages them.

#### Procedure

1. Add a `MonitoringStack` resource using the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1alpha1
kind: MonitoringStack
metadata:
  labels:
    coo: example
  name: sample-monitoring-stack
  namespace: coo-demo
spec:
  logLevel: debug
  retention: 1d
  resourceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
```

2. A Prometheus resource named `sample-monitoring-stack` is generated in the `coo-demo` namespace. Retrieve the managed fields of the generated Prometheus resource:

```shell
oc -n coo-demo get Prometheus.monitoring.rhobs -oyaml --show-managed-fields
```

Example output:

```yaml
managedFields:
- apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
  fieldsType: FieldsV1
  fieldsV1:
    f:metadata:
      f:labels:
        f:app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: {}
        f:app.kubernetes.io/name: {}

  manager: observability-operator
  operation: Apply
- apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
  fieldsType: FieldsV1
  fieldsV1:
    f:status:
      .: {}
      f:availableReplicas: {}
      f:conditions:
        .: {}
        k:{"type":"Available"}:

          f:availableReplicas: {}
          f:replicas: {}
          f:shardID: {}
          f:unavailableReplicas: {}
          f:updatedReplicas: {}
      f:unavailableReplicas: {}
      f:updatedReplicas: {}
  manager: PrometheusOperator
  operation: Update
  subresource: status
```

3. Check the `metadata.managedFields` values and observe that some fields in `metadata` and `spec` are managed by the `MonitoringStack` resource.

4. Modify a field that is not controlled by the `MonitoringStack` resource:

    a. Change `spec.enforcedSampleLimit`, which is a field not set by the `MonitoringStack` resource. Create the file `prom-spec-edited.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
    kind: Prometheus
    metadata:
      name: sample-monitoring-stack
      namespace: coo-demo
    spec:
      enforcedSampleLimit: 1000
    ```

    b. Apply the YAML by running the following command:

    ```shell
    oc apply -f ./prom-spec-edited.yaml --server-side
    ```

    Note: You must use the `--server-side` flag.

    c. Get the changed Prometheus object and note that there is one more section in `managedFields` which has `spec.enforcedSampleLimit`.

    ```shell
    oc get prometheus -n coo-demo
    ```

    Example output:

    ```yaml
    managedFields:
    - apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
      fieldsType: FieldsV1
      fieldsV1:
        f:metadata:
          f:labels:
            f:app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: {}
            f:app.kubernetes.io/name: {}
            f:app.kubernetes.io/part-of: {}
        f:spec:
          f:enforcedSampleLimit: {}
      manager: kubectl
      operation: Apply
    ```

5. Modify a field that is managed by the `MonitoringStack` resource:

    a. Change `spec.LogLevel`, which is managed by the `MonitoringStack` resource, using the following YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    # changing the logLevel from debug to info
    apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
    kind: Prometheus
    metadata:
      name: sample-monitoring-stack
      namespace: coo-demo
    spec:
      logLevel: info
    ```

    b. Apply the YAML by running the following command:

    ```shell
    oc apply -f ./prom-spec-edited.yaml --server-side
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    error: Apply failed with 1 conflict: conflict with "observability-operator": .spec.logLevel
    Please review the fields above--they currently have other managers. Here
    are the ways you can resolve this warning:
    * If you intend to manage all of these fields, please re-run the apply
      command with the `--force-conflicts` flag.
    * If you do not intend to manage all of the fields, please edit your
      manifest to remove references to the fields that should keep their
      current managers.
    * You may co-own fields by updating your manifest to match the existing
      value; in this case, you'll become the manager if the other manager(s)
      stop managing the field (remove it from their configuration).
    See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#conflicts
    ```

    Notice that the field `spec.logLevel` cannot be changed using Server-Side Apply, because it is already managed by `observability-operator`.

    Use the `--force-conflicts` flag to force the change.

    ```shell
    oc apply -f ./prom-spec-edited.yaml --server-side --force-conflicts
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    prometheus.monitoring.rhobs/sample-monitoring-stack serverside-applied
    ```

    With the `--force-conflicts` flag, the field can be forced to change, but since the same field is also managed by the `MonitoringStack` resource, the Observability Operator detects the change, and reverts it back to the value set by the `MonitoringStack` resource.

    Note: Some Prometheus fields generated by the `MonitoringStack` resource are influenced by the fields in the `MonitoringStack` `spec` stanza, for example, `logLevel`. These can be changed by changing the `MonitoringStack` `spec`.

6. To change the `logLevel` in the Prometheus object, apply the following YAML to change the `MonitoringStack` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1alpha1
kind: MonitoringStack
metadata:
  name: sample-monitoring-stack
  labels:
    coo: example
spec:
  logLevel: info
```

7. To confirm that the change has taken place, query for the log level by running the following command:

```shell
oc -n coo-demo get Prometheus.monitoring.rhobs -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.logLevel}'
```

Example output:

```text
info
```
